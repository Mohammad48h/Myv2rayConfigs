# Myv2rayConfigs
 this repository searches for various v2ray configs in mostly iranian channels and updates every 1 hour and saves output to a txt file . 
 + i was using this for myself as a personal project but i thought maybe making it public would help some people have unrestricted internet
+ the code of the finder.py is fully generated by AI and the telegram.session.aes256 is just the session file for github actions so it updates automatically you can edit the code to use your telegram account.
